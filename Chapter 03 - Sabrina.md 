Last night wasn't as eventful as the night before, it seems like the diner was
closed, all the lights were blacked out and no one was home. So I bounced home
and ate some leftovers. Nothing special to that is for sure. It all seemed to be
stale and dried. It is pretty slim pickins where I am, the roommates tend to get
the better stuff.

Today marks another day on the job, I feel pretty special making it as far as I
have, not a to many of guys in my line of duty make it that far and the leave pieces
of themselves for the other to pick up. I guess that is what it is, but it
really can you going in circles, if you know what I mean. Especially seeing
someone taken down right in front of you, that is when it really gets hard.

But you have to keep the fight going, always be on the look out and make sure if
something doesn't feel right you get out of there on time.

I'm back at the office, the coffee is a day old and the paperwork last night is
stacked in front of me. I look back over it and try to gather the details of
what happened. I look at my notes and try to get an overview of the case once
more. If I let my mind slip a little, the killer will gain justice. This case
requires 2 things: coffee and pastries.

I ate off a bit of a danish while looking at my notes and contemplating things,
my hands start to fidget, I hope I didn't pick up the habit from the Musculus
last night. I wipe my mouth and get a move on. It is time to hit the streets and
figure out who this Sabrina is. If I can get her alone and away from the guy
they call Fluff, I might be able to get a better testimony from her.

I might be able to force her into giving up what little knowledge she might
have.

Buzzing around town, I spot her, and take my post. I try to blend in with the
scenery so she doesn't get suspicious or call me out. Being inconspicuous can be
on of the hardest parts of my job.

Watching her, it seems her and Fluff are an inseparable pair. He is always
following her at her heels. Constantly listening her, just waiting for some
words of affirmation or something like that. It is kind of disgusting the level
of devotion this guy has towards her. Maybe this is true love.

After watching her run this town, it looks like there are some places that Fluff
isn't allowed. I'm not sure what their relationship is but it seems like he
knows his bounds and she knows she runs this place.

Now I just wait. I have to wait for them to be separate and besides paperwork,
you see the clock move on this job with an incredibly slow pace some pace some
days. That doesn't bother me much, just taking in the world, but today, I have
this itch that needs to be... well... solved.

That is the thing about these cases, is they feel like that part in your back
you can't reach. that part you want someone else to scratch but can't. You have
to direct the person like a conductor in a symphony. Letting them know that it
takes ever more vigor, lighter, right, left, higher, lower, softer, faster, and
then when the symphony is about to hit the climax, another part of your back
starts to itch but you feel to self conscious to ask about it again.

As the itch grows, Sabrina seems to getting a little more tired after the
morning chaos. It seems like it may be time for one of the siestas. She retires
to her digs, and Fluff waits outside for her posting guard. It doesn't seem to
take to long before Fluff falls asleep on the job right outside her door on the
stoop. I don't complain, I gently make it past him and into the place.

I scan the place for initial clues and in order to get my bearings. The place
looks familiar, similar to my place, that is how most these rooms go in this
part of town. The ceiling fan puts out a nice breeze and the temperature in the
room is warm, making it easy to move without being heard. She looks a little
restless sleeping there. I sit and just wait for her to wake up. I take out my
badge. I want to make sure she doesn't scream when she wakes up.

She is blond and tall. She has a pretty face that looks like it hasn't seen much
but something also tells me that pretty face can cause quite the havoc. She
tosses in her bed and with her mouth agape I can see she is missing a couple
teeth.

Not sure what that is about.

She sleeps for a total of 43 minutes. During which she is restless in her dreams,
you can see her eyes move behind the eyelids, as if examining the world of works
around her.

When she awakes, I am there first thing. I get in her face and start to
interrogate. Waiting makes me anxious and little bit of caffeine makes me jittery,
so I'm ready to start grilling her.

I start by trying to be civil, just letting her know who I am and how it
concerns her, but she doesn't seem to buy it. She gives me a couple hand waves
and practically walks right through me. I follow her incessantly while she is in
here. I figure that as long as she is without Fluff, I can maybe get some more
knowledge about the case.

I keep asking her questions and I keep pestering trying to get at something, but
this lady is a rock, she just bats me away and doesn't say much of anything.

She made about 5 circles in her room, changing her clothes and picking up her
belongings, and then taking different ones out. Nothing really to note about her
behavior it looks like she was just having some time to herself.

So I keep pestering and then I hear footsteps approaching the door. It doesn't
sound like Fluff. From what I've heard of him he is a pretty hard breather. I
pause though, this is one of those situations where I could definitely be in the
wrong place at the wrong time.

I bolt it to behind the door, It is one of the swinging ones. As the person
enters the room, I make a quick exit behind him and them and take off. It isn't
hard to escape the scene, I'm a pretty small guy, so not a lot of people take
note of me.

Leaving the place, I pace my mind and try to piece together what just happened,
there wasn't much that went down there so it seems like now is the time to take
case notes:

  July 09, 2014:

  At 1012 went and staked out the blond and her friend, Sabina and Fluff. Fluff
  is incessantly around. Always touching himself in public. Might need to
  report it later.

  Sabrina was walking around the place like she owned it. She was wearing
  leggings and a loose shirt. Her belly was hanging out from the bottom of the
  shirt and it looked like there were stains in the shirt from possibly wine. It
  seemed early but she was stumbling quite a bit and needed to hit the hay
  midday.

  Around 1303, she retired into her place. Fluff posted outside the door, but
  quickly fell asleep.

  Upon both sleeping, I made my way into the bedroom to try and get more
  information from her alone. As she slept she mutters some indistinguishable
  words, nothing that would give away the case.

  She was the size of her bed and the place was a mess.

  When she woke up, I questioned her multiple times about the murder, about her,
  about her and fluff, and there were no answers.

  Fluff may be our only lead at this point.

After writing the case notes, it seems to me that maybe I didn't push hard
enough or that I put too much stock into what Sugar had to say, but in reality,
he said a lot and I can only listen to so much information before tuning it out.

I'm about the paperwork, not the listening. That is why I'm not a psychiatrist.

I move about a little and try to stay in the shadows. I want to blend right in,
Sabrina is back to ruling everything. Fluff is at her heels.

It is now that I need to wait and hope for more time or I need to get inside and
see the group and see what this Fluff is all about. I was never much for
undercover work, mainly because people like me don't fit in to well. The squad
knew that and the work was never assigned to me.

As I think about it, it seems like a worse and worse idea. It is this quick
stupidity that can come to you in boredom that ends your life.

I wait and watch the process of the day move along. It is here that I see that
while I thought it was Sabrina in control, it seems like she is working for a
couple of people. They look pretty nondescript but the way they boss her around,
you know they have an arsenal somewhere.

Eventually I will target them.

Fluff and Sabrina separate for the night and now is my time to go tackle this
Fluff character before Sabrina comes back and tries to sway his thinking.

I move out of the shadows and into the open. I don't typically like to be so
exposed, but this is something I have to deal with. Fluff wanders around and
finally finds a place to his feet up. As he does this, I make my move. I wonder
over his way, not too close, but close enough to make my presence felt.

This is raw cop work and there is no substitute for it. It isn't creative, it
isn't glamorous and hardly is it anything anyone wants to do. It barely makes
the bills and the life is hard on you. But someone has to do it.
