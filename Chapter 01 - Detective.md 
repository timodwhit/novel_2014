We see things. We see a lot of things in my line of work. There is always
something happening. That something is usually death. I am a detective.

This story is going to be about a murder and the testimonies I gather to solve the murder. I'm not a genius and nor is the victim. In fact, the whole situation seems to be full of the average telling average stories. Like most murders that aren't found in shows, movies, or books.

Day 1:

Murders are quite mundane things that are fueled by quite the average sentiments that boil down to some emotion more innate than the desire to eat.

Based on that, you would think that I have gotten used to the way death works and the way society treats it. And sure, I have, there is no shock value to see the blood and guts at a scene. There is no magic to the cruelty that I have witnessed any more. When you start the job, there is a thrill to it, you start the day and you aren't sure what you are going to see. You may see death, you may see justice, but you will see something for sure. And that something is usually paperwork.

I'm not bad at the paperwork, nor do I mind it. I've always been good at filling out forms. I was the quickest to get tests done in school, not because I knew the answers but because I wanted to get the form filled out. My test taking skills were more about my work ethic "Don't complain, do." So I would sit through the test and just fill things out in the most appropriate way I knew how to answer the question. I would put all the information I had on the topic and hope that something stuck. It is the same way I approach a case. All the words should be spoken, documented, and then the case can be solved, because I'll be damned if one of my cases gets reopened because of some typo or some missed information that wasn't documented.

My colleagues don't care for this trait. Having to write every detail isn't exactly the strong suit of most. They say that they are the big picture type. Well big pictures don't get painted in 1 stroke, my friends. It is the details that form them, the intricacies. Same with the "Big Picture" of a murder investigation. But we can get to that later.

When I was kid, I wasn't a good student. I did all the work and I got everything done, but I was too into others and what they were thinking. I would sit there and look around trying to analyze everybody's strengths, weaknesses, truths and lies. They thought I had the ADD or some deficiency in communicative skills, but I knew I was just forming my mind into what I really wanted to do when I was older. I was working out how I could track all of them in the fury of their lives.

I grew up and went to school on the southside. A third story apartment where there were plenty of windows, but hardly any doors to move out of. I had a view of the courtyard, a nice one where the kids could play and dogs could run around. If the tennants were lucky, the flowers would grow, but that typically depended on the lawn men and whether they showed up to pull the weeds. I moved out of the place quickly, not too far, but got a place of my own with some roommates. We split the rent is the way I put it, but others would say that I am a free loader. Can you believe they would say that to a detective? I am trying to serve them and they treat me like I am a freeloader or a pest. My job is my rent. I keep the information and the peace.

My parents were distant as I was growing up, they have passed now. My brothers and sisters did their own thing as well, most of them have passed on or we just don't keep in touch. There were a lot of us and times were pretty tough for everyone. There was no warm household full of food, nor was there an expectation to anything but grow and be our own. We needed to grab what we could when we could. No one complained about this, and as a result, my mom just kept popping them out. It didn't take long for me to realize that if I wanted to help my family, I would need to put away those that do wrong or die trying.

So here I am, still on the southside and doing what I love to do. And what does today present to me, but a murder. And it is a fresh one indeed. It is slightly colder outside and it seems to have taken me a little longer to get up and going this morning. Sleeping by a cold window makes it hard to get up and out of bed. But when I got the news, it was all the buzz and I was up and out of there. The blinds opened and I made my way to the scene of the crime. The commute in was nothing special. Some construction on the way and a slight detour that was necessary. I didn't think much about it, but it did allow me to stop and grab a bite to eat. Wasn't like the victim was going anywhere.

I got to the crime scene a little after 9. The body was reported an hour before I got there and the blood was beginning to dry. You could see the head had been blugeoned and there wasn't much left of the upper torso. Whatever killed it got him good and it got him quick. The blood was smeared from his head about 2 body lengths infront of him, obviously lessening in amounts from head to trail. One of his arms seems to be mutilated in the attack as well, hard to tell what exactly got him, but I imagine it was something heavy.

There was no weapon directly around the body. Not sure if it was stolen or what happened, but it seems my colleagues have neglected to tape off the scene once again. I was just given the location of the murder, you would think that I would have backup and more help than I do, but murders here don't happen like that. Someone tells someone and the first available detective visits the scene. If there are others available, they help, otherwise you are there with the body and no backup until the coroner takes away the body.

The weapon is typically missing in most of my cases. Today, I suspect it is gang related and the weapon has been properly disposed of. But in time, I shall find it.

I always find the weapon.

There is too much DNA evidence on weapons for them to go missing. And from the looks of this scene, you won't be able to wash away what that weapon contains.

The body would be pretty disturbing if this were my first day, the head is flattened and the intestines are coming out of the torso, which looks bloated next to the head. Doesn't help that the body is being forced at an angle because of the limbs and the direction they are unnaturally facing. But enough of my views, here is what the case file for day 1 will say:

  July 7th, 2014:

  Call was placed at 7:45am from a Miss Rita McIntire. She was hysterical in her call but was able to identify where the body was.

  The detective, Badge 0718, approached the scene to find a mutilated John Doe. No identification was found on the victim and the surrounding neighbors were unable to identify body.

  The head was flattened with a heavy object at a great speed, but that object was not on the crime scene. It is known that the victim was laying in the location where he was killed. There was blood running from the victim's head onto the ground two body lengths in front of him. The victim appeared to be middle aged and on the bigger side. It is possible the victim was taller than average but an exact height could not be gathered because of the mutilation of the victim.

  Because of the size and height of the victim, contact has been made with wealthier families.

  The victim had no unique markings on his body, nor any piercings (sans the murder).

  The victim was murdered in a hallway of an apartment. The floors were Teak with crumbs on them. They floor also showed signs of a pet of some sort because of the amount of hair, but the pet was no where to be seen as well. There was mud on the floor that is currently being sampled by the lab.

  The molding was white, as were the walls. Even with the gruesome murder there was no sign of blood on either the walls or the molding. The ceiling was spotless as well.

  The body has since been moved. Blood samples have been sent to the lab.  Cops are on the beat looking for connections. Interviews will start tomorrow with others in the apartment complex.

  The landlord has been contacted about the identification of the victim.

There is more to the case than that, obviously. I have attached pictures and diagrams that show exactly where the murder happened and how the body looks. I don't take a chance with these things, you can't recreate a murder scene, even though it seems like they recreate themselves in my dreams in plentitude.

As the week goes on with this case, I will conduct about 20 interviews and try to get in touch with any clues. I'm guessing someone or something will have the information needed.

That is always the case of cases.

Tomorrow I will start diving into the case work. Talking with people and trying to get a grasp of who killed this JD and what were the motives behind it. I have my suscipions but those have been wrong before.

First things first, a bite to eat.
