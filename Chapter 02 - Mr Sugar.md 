Last night was perfect. Nothing like a good meal after a murder.

I went to this diner where the food is always pretty cheap I'm pretty good
friends with the chef, him and I have been hanging out since I was kid, it
seems. He practically raised me on his food.

Well last night, he was feeling pretty generous, I was able to eat a whole meal
and try out his new dish without even having to pay. But then things got pretty
weird it seems his wife didn't really want me there. She started waving her
hands and what not, saying some stuff and I got out of there in a hurry. But it
was okay, because I still got my fill.

I think hit the bottle, it helps me sleep a little better. Went home, found the
blinds closed and snuck into bed.

It was another cold night, so waking up took me a little longer again. When I
finally woke up and shook the dust off from the night before, I was hungry as
could be. I grabbed a piece of pastry on my way out, a hit of coffee and left
the place in a sizable hurry.

When I got to the office I was late but no one bothered me about it. Same old
traffic and it just so happens that today the detours were different than the
day before. I'm not sure how the crews expect anyone to get into work on time.

The office isn't much to speak about, it is pretty typical cop office, a couple
desks, back to back and front to front, a coffee maker and shitty filing
cabinets filled with paperwork that work horses like me fill out and never is
read, until work horses like me get suspicious about something and decide to try
and figure out if this has happened before and if the case should is a string of
incidents.

After settling down in my desk, some paperwork came through from the landlord
about his name and his address and how to reach him. I immediately left the
office at this point and headed to meet the landlord in person.

The landlord was a strange character to say the least. He was nosy and squirmed
at the same time. He had some hairs that were going gray, but mostly he was off
brown. He invited me into talk but I could tell he wasn't comfortable with it.
We exchanged our pleasantries and began to talk.

"So what do you know about the victim?" I asked.

"Oh that guy, he is a free loader." He said, his teeth clicking as he made the
statement. His hands were in constant motion and his head wouldn't stop looking
around. From what I could tell I would say that this guy was a culprit in what
happened.

"Ah, why didn't you evict him?" I press. The statement freeloader irked me, he
was still a citizen and all.

"Well, his roommates never complained and their good people. They pay the bills.
They give me food sometimes. Never a trap with them. Just good working people.
Yeah, I really like those roommates. shame and all what happened to the guy but
I would be pretty much at a loss with out those people. Are they okay still? No
one hurt them, right?" His hands were still wringing in a nervous twitch and his
head never stopped the side to side.

"What? Yeah they're fine. I'm only here to talk about the victim, do you have
more information about him?" I press. This guy seems tweaked out on some
poisonous drug or another.

"Oh yeah, sorry. That guy, his name was Dom. Well that is what people called
him. Always hung around people, but never seemed to be really wanted there. Just
a pest in groups. Something was off, but yeah, you know who you should talk to,
is Mr. Sugar. Yeah, Mr. Sugar is the guy that'll know more."

"Who?"

"Mr. Sugar. The guy at the counter, he has a white pinstriped suit. Wears that
funky silver cap. You didn't notice him when you came in?"

"Yeah, I noticed him alright, he gave me a look that seemed to change with the
light. Seems a little sketchy to me."

"Ah, that guy. Nah, that guy ain't nothing to worry about. He is a little
flamboyant but about as sweet as can be. He hung around Dom... Dom hung around
him is probably the better way to put... Hey listen, I gotta scoot out of here.
Errands and stuff" His mouth was still going and now it seems like he was
sniffing profusely for being home. Maybe it was the drugs that were getting him.
It isn't my job to figure that out, so I typically let it pass and leave the
place.

Here is what the case report would say:

  July 8th, 2014:

  Landlord, M. Musculus, reported back to the station over night and reported he knew who the
  tenant of the apartment was.

  Badge 0718 reported to the land lords hole in the wall place and spoke with
  the landlord. The living quarters was quite a mess. It seemed like the
  landlord was quite the hoarder and many collections of strange items without
  any real connection. No one but the land lord was home, but from the hoards it
  appears that the land lord had a family. No questions were asked about them.

  Mr. Musculus seems to be on some type of drug because of his actions, a
  straight answer didn't seem possible even when direct.

  Badge 0718 did manage to get the name of the JD: Dom. No other details were
  given about the character, except that he hung around a Mr. Sugar and was "free
  loading" off of his roommates before he passed away.

  More investigation will go into Mr. Sugar.

  The landlord might get into some trouble soon, wouldn't be surprised if there
  was a past record of theft. However, based on the size of the landlord it
  seems that he did pretty well for himself. He was bigger than average and
  wouldn't go unnoticed if he came in.

As I finished writing field notes, I decided to go talk to Mr. Sugar and that is
where I am presently.

Mr. Sugar is quite the rotund character. Nothing too striking about him besides
his garb. He seems quite dull and used if you give him a really hard look.

I tend to give people a couple glances. Always taking in the world, you have to
look at people from many angles to get their true nature.

Mr. Musculus was right, Mr Sugar sure is a flamboyant thing, not sure him and I
will have much in common but I still introduce myself after he gets done pouring
his inner most feelings out to the one in front of me.

"Oh hey there, I was expecting you. After I heard what happened to Dom, I just
knew that people would be looking for me. They always come looking for me. Try
to shake me down and get something out of me, but honestly, I don't know
anything about Dom. He was just a guy that hung around"

"Where did he hang around?"

"Well, anywhere I was naturally, but that tends to be the case for a lot of
with his condition. He never really wanted to have a conversation or talk too
much so I couldn't really get to know him. A lot of what he said and did was
pretty cryptic, but I never thought it was murder worthy."

"What do you mean by that?"

"Well he was just the type to hover around and take things in, but never
really participate with the group. He kind of was just a free loader and
sometimes it was really imposing. Like this one time, I was hanging out, I took
off my cap and I was trying to get my fill. This guy had wonderful hands that
would just give you such the squeeze... He was able really turn me around and
make me feel whole again... Well Dom came in and just started to eat, right then
and then there. he was trying to get the guy to notice him it seemed. I couldn't
figure it out."

"So what did you do?"

"Well naturally, I let the guy finish me off and then I put my cap back on and
gave Dom the silent treatment. What else is someone supposed to do in my
situation?"

"Yeah, I guess. So tell me where were you yesterday? Did you see anything
suspicious?""

"Oh yesterday was such a good day. In the morning, three people came and visited
me here. It was nice, nothing unusual about it. It was a little draining having
to deal with each of them, but then again, what work day isn't draining. So then
after that, I just hung around, the days are pretty slow for me, nothing really
goes on. That is usually when my friends come and visit me. Come to think of it,
Dom didn't come around here yesterday... I guess that is because he was knocked
off in the morning. He did visit me the day before. He looked bad though."

"How so?"

"Well normally, Dom looks pretty bad, he was always on the larger size, but
never seemed to get his fill. And trust me, I know how important it is to get
your fill. Every now and then I would give him something if I had it, but the
day before, I was out. He came here looking and I wasn't able to provide. I just
had to chat with him.

"He gave me quite the stink when I didn't have anything. It looked to me like he
had been throwing up all morning. Not sure what he got into, or where he was the
night before. But his movements seemed pretty erratic. Something was off,
definitely off, and that is saying something considering who Dom was.

"I didn't think much of it though, you know people have off days, especially
after hard nights. I heard he was hanging around Sabrina and Fluff the day
before he saw me. So it makes sense that he would be having a rough day. I didn't
ask many questions, just the formalities. 'How is it going?' 'What's up?' and
such. He was curt with his responses so I just asked him what he was doing that
night

"He said he was hanging out with Sabrina and Fluff again. I didn't think that
was a good idea, but really who am I tell him what to do. Well, that night, I
went out for desert, shared some excellent times over coffee and pie and
then headed back here to prep for the next day.

"I must have fallen asleep here, it happens quite a bit.

"But anyhow, when I woke up to the sun, it was already time to start working.
I got the dust shaken off and next thing you know, I heard a thwat as something
high pitch moved through the air. I didn't see anything, someone was standing in
front of me and the commotion was quite loud, I think I was talking. Not sure
really. What exactly was happening to be honest. It is all kind of hazy, my
eyesight isn't what it used to be.

"When I was first starting out, I had crystal clear vision of everything, but
now, it seems like things are getting foggier by the day. Doesn't stop me from
wanting me fill. Am I right?

"Well, basically, I couldn't see anything, it was only later that I heard that
Dom was dead and his body was laying there.

"Personally, I'm glad I never saw it. That would have been too much for me. Just
too much really.

"And now here we are. I'm just Mr. Sugar at the counter.

"So you heard something high pitch and then a thwat? And who is Fluff and
Sabrina."

"Yeah that is right, high pitch like something moving quickly through the air
and the thwat was quick and precise. Sounded like it hurt a whole hell of lot if
you asked me. But I get my crystals off with a little bit of pain like that."

The conversation continues for a little bit without any particular direction. He
loves sharing all hes got that is for sure. Really quite open about everything.
But me, I just need to keep this case moving forward so I thank him for his time
and get a move on for some fresh air. I may be coming back to this guy if time
permits and the case goes cold.

Here is what my case notes will look like.

  July 8, 2014:

  Mr Sugar, counter attendant. Rotund character wears only pinstripe white suit
  and silver cap.

  Gave name of Fluff and Sabrina. Seems like Sabrina is a blond with pigtails
  and a positive disposition on the outside but a temper can come up at anytime.
  Fluff seems to be her companion who follows her around, protecting her. He has
  black hair and can be pretty vocal about how he feels.

  More detail is needed about both suspects.

  Mr. Sugar seems to have an alibi but need to validate it.

  Also, need to ask forensics about high pitch noise through the air and thwat.
  Sounds like the guy was killed with a mysterious cannonball, if you ask me.

As I move about, I take in all the information I can about the place, how it
looks with the light and how the air is flowing about, everything could be a
sign to what was the ultimate end to Dom's life, the question is still who ended
it.

---

I'm back in the office now and the day has worn me out. I have gathered some
crumbs of what is supposed to be an office meal. The platter was pretty bare by
the time I got there but I picked what I could from it and moved back to my desk.

I comb over the details from the day and as things progress, I start to feel the
fatigue of a introvert talking with an extrovert. I write a few last notes and
then decide I should call it night. I don't at that moment drop what I'm doing
though, that isn't my style. I have to fill out my reports.

Paperwork here I come.

I finish with the paperwork and hour later and head out of the office. I'm the
last one in, not saying everyone else is lazy. They just tend to their needs
closer than those of the city. The night has turned cold again, I try to move
briskly but I end up just taking it slow trying to keep what warmth I have at my
core.

All I'm hoping is that the diner is open and lets me back in there. As long as
the wife isn't there, I should be good.
