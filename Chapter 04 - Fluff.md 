As I hang around Fluff, I realize that this guy doesn't really have much going
on for himself, he is quiet character and pretty content with himself. He is the
basic type and doesn't have much ado about anything beside tend the needs of
Sabrina.

I wait for him to calm down. I can tell he is exasperated from the day's
activities and it is about time he took a break. He is breathing heavily, so I
don't want to catch him out of breath or on the move, I'll make sure he is nice
and rested before I make my move.

I inch closer to him as his heart beat decreases. I can sense that he is just
letting the day pass and there won't be much more to his thoughts soon.

I come up behind his year and whisper:

"Hey there fluff."

He snaps his head and lets out a grunt. He must not have seen me, and clearly
wasn't ready to talk, but again I whisper to him.

"Hey Fluff, what you know about Dom?"

He seems more visually iritated this time around. I think I might be on to
something. Even though it may seem like not a lot is going on behind those eyes,
he is still capturing the world. I'm guessing he sees a lot of the world
differently than I do, but I can bring this out of him. I can bring the murder
out of him trapped mind.

"Fluff, do you know anything about the murder of Dom?" I ask again, a softer
ton, trying to ease my presence.

"Fluff, it is okay, I was friends with Dom, and I'm just looking to know what
happened." I press.

"Seriously Fluff, we can chat, just you and I bud."

After moments of fluttering around and trying to get him to notice my words he
finally speaks, "Stop bothering me."

Now that is the spirit that I have been looking for. I've been looking to see
something out this guy. Acting so docile around Sabrina, I bet I can get this
guy out of his shell and into my life.

I can bring this guy into the boxing rink.

"So you do know what happened to Dom?"

"I didn't say that, I just would like to be alone."

"I'll leave you be once you let me know what has happened to Dom, Fluff." I inch
closer to his face.

At this Dom snaps at me. "Away." Snap. "Away."

He is getting louder with each successive snap. I am putting myself in more
danger as the time progresses and as I push further and further under his skin.

I retreat a little and try to maintain the come demeanor without to much extra
noise in the equation. "Alright, Dom. We can talk this out.

"Do you remember Dom? Mr. Sugar said he was slightly pesky and hung around you
guys quite a bit." My tone was softer and more logical. Direct and firm, but not
demanding. It seems like that is what this guy prefers.

"Yeah, I remember him"

"Do you know any of who might want to kill him?"

"Yeah, I've some good ideas."

"Can you share those good ideas?"

"What's in it for me?"

"Helping solve a case. Making sure the dead rest peacefully. Doing your civic
duty"

"Yeah, but what's in it for me?" He presses the case further towards me. I
realize that in order to make this work, I'm going to have to incentivize the
prize. Make him want something, or try to figure out something I can give him
that Sabrina can't.

That seems like quite the imposition. Sabrina doesn't necessarily let Fluff
starve, he didn't get the name fluff because of his disposition on life. He is a
big guy and stammers around.

"What if I told you I knew this guy at the Diner and he can get you the good
stuff? The stuff you've been wanting? You know what I'm talking about."

"I might be interested in it if it is the stuff that I am thinking of."

"It is my friend. I can promise you that." Working as a detective I have found
that most have something that they really want and no matter how much they ask
or how hard they work, they can't attain it.

A man in person can be free if he could suppress his desires.

"So, tell me, how did Dom die?"

"I actually don't know too much about how Dom died, I just know he did. Sabrina
and I were walking around and all the sudden... well all the sudden Dom was
gone. I was watching what sabrina was doing, making sure she was out of trouble
and such, and when I looked back, Dom was on the floor."

"That is all you know?"

"Yeah, I think others saw it, I'm almost sure of that. Not sure why they haven't
spoke up yet, but they definitely had to see something." Fluff clearly was
disturbed by this.

"So who should I talk to?"

"I would go back to Mr. Sugar and see who is hanging around him. I know it looks
like he is a lone ranger, but there is often a crew surrounding him, in plain
sight."

FLuff must be calling my bluff. Trying to throw me off his scent. I know for a
fact that there were no others around Mr. Sugar

Now that I think about it though, his outfit was pretty distracting. The way the
light hit his hat, it was hard not to stare andget lost in it.

"Anybody else I should talk with Fluff? It seemed like Sabrina might know..."

He cuts me off mid sentence and begins to look visibly angry with me. His eyes
begin to dialate and I can tell that something is about to get really bad for
me.

Right then he lunges at me. He just snapped.

I try to get away but the further I go the faster he runs.

I eventually get the upper hand and take a hiding spot. It isn't ideal, from my
hiding spot, I can tell the Fluff is out there pacing back and forth, just
waiting. It seems like mentioning Sabrina is not the way to get on hisgood side.

I take a minute tobreak and relax.

Here are my case notes:

  July 08, 2014:

  Fluff is an older guy. Some grays on his chin, but nothing to distinguishable.

  Must have done some time at a young age. Not easily trusting.

  Do not mention Sabrina to him.

  Gave up that Mr. Sugar might be heading a movement and that they hide in plain
  sight.
